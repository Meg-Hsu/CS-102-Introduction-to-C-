        // (sec > 1 == " seconds" : " second") is used to choose between singular or plural form depending on the number given. This is used the same way with minutes and hours throughout the rest of the code.
        // std::setfill('0') and std::setw(2) are used for numbers less than 10. For example, if the output for seconds was 8, the program would display xx:xx:08 instead of xx:xx:8.

    //all units of time (seconds, minutes, and hours) use std::setfill('0') and std::setw(2) for formatting purposes.
    //(hour > 1? " hours" : " hour") and variations of it with minutes and seconds are used to ensure that the program outputs the proper grammar based on the input given.
