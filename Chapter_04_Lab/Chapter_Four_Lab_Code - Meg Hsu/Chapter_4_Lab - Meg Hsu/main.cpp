// Program Name: Chapter Four Lab (Body Fat Calculator)
// Author: Meg Hsu
// Date: 26 June 2020
// Description: This program is used to calculate the body fat of a person using information provided by the person using this program.

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace::std;

//Function Name: get_value
//Purpose: To make sure values used in the program are positive numbers
//Parameter: The name of the measurements used in this program
//Return Code: Returns a positive number. If the value used is negative, the program will make the user input a valid number.

int get_value(string name){
    while(true){
        cout << "Please enter a measurement for " << name << ": ";
        int value;

    }
}

//Function Name: main
//Purpose: Entry of program
//Parameter: n/a
//Return Code: returns zero or nonzero value which indicates if the program runs smoothly or if there are any problems.
