// Program Name: Chapter Five Lab (Profit Maximization Calculator)
// Author: Meg Hsu
// Date: 3 July 2020
// Description: This program is used to calculate the amount of apartments that need to be rented out to make the maximum amount of profit.

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

//Function Name: get_value
//Purpose: To make sure values used in the program are positive numbers
//Parameter: The name of the measurements used in this program
//Return Code: Returns a positive number. If the value used is negative, the program will make the user input a valid number.

int get_value(string name){
    while(true){
        cout << "Please enter a value for " << name << ": ";
        int value;
        cin >> value;
        if (value <=0){
            cout << value << " is not a valid measurement for " << name << ".";
            cout << " Please enter a positive number.\n\n";
        }
        else {
            return value;
        }
    }
}

//Function Name: main
//Purpose: Entry of program
//Parameter: n/a
//Return Code: returns zero or nonzero value which indicates if the program runs smoothly or if there are any problems.
